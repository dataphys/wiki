====== Teaching ======

This page collects resources for teaching data physicalization. If you developed teaching material and want to list them here, please send the link and a short description to info@dataphys.org or, if you plan to contribute on a more regular basis to this wiki, just ask us for an account using the same address.

====== Teaching Material ======
Material which can be reused by others for their own teaching. All resources should indicate a license for reuse and give credit to those who created the material.
  * 2021 - [[http://web.uvic.ca/~cperin/teaching/2021/infovis/documents/personal-vis.html|Assignment on //Personal Data Physicalization//]] covering instructions for how to collect data, design constraints, and deliverables. This is part of a course given by Charles Perin at University of Victoria.
  * 2020 - [[https://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~lora.oehlberg/tui-w20/#assignment3|A data physicalization assignment]] (assignment 3) in the context of the course //Tangible & Physical HCI// given by Lora Oehlberg at the University of Calgary.
  * 2016 – [[http://dataphys.org/workshops/drs16/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/07/cards_final.pdf|A set of cards providing constraints]] for a data physicalization exercise. CC-BY-4.0 Graphic design: Pauline Gourlet. Illustration for scenario cards: Samuel Huron. Concept: Yvonne Jansen, Pauline Gourlet, Samuel Huron, Uta Hinrichs, Trevor Hogan. See the [[http://dataphys.org/workshops/drs16|related workshop report]] for how to use them.

====== Teaching Reports ======
A list of any form of report illustrating how a course or workshop was organized or what its outcomes are.
  * 2016 – [[in|French]] [https://strabic.fr/Et-si-nous-fossilisions-nos-donnees Report of a 3-day workshop] from March 29 to 31, 2016 at Stereolux and Fabmake in Nantes, France. It was organized by Stéphane Buellet (together with Julia Puyo) invited by Boris Letessier.
  * 2016 – [[http://dataphys.org/workshops/drs16/|A workshop report from the 2016 DRS conference]] which used a protocol that could also be applied in a class room. The workshop was run by Yvonne Jansen, Pauline Gourlet, Samuel Huron, Uta Hinrichs, Trevor Hogan.
  * 2016 – Not a real report but [[https://www.flickr.com/photos/cuivienna/sets/72157667253863706|photos from the hands-on part of a 3h course]] given by Yvonne Jansen for students of the //Creative Technology// master at TU Twente in 2016.
  * 2014-2017 – [[https://www.datavizexperiments.org/|Data Viz Experiments]] summarizing the outcomes of yearly projects by the Fine Arts Data Visualization Lab at the University of Lethbridge led by Leanne Elias and Denton Fredrickson.
