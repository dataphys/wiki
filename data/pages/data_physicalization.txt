====== Data Physicalization ======


Physical representations of data have existed for thousands of years. Now, with advances in digital fabrication, actuated tangible interfaces, and shape-changing displays, a new area of research is emerging: **data physicalization**.

Data physicalization aims to help people explore, understand, and communicate data using computer-supported physical data representations. These representations are called **physicalizations**, analogously to visualizations – their purely visual counterpart. This wiki provides reading material and a forum for all interested in this topic.
