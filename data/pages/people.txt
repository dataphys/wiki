Paris, France. | Since September 2022, I am teaching the Information Design course at Concordia University. Bringing together students with different art and design expertise (graphic design, computational art, product design, etc...), the course has an experimental focus on data physicalization. In this theory-studio course, students are invited to engage with a dataset highlighting social, environmental, political, or economical issues and design a physicalization of it. Creations are open to all types of physical objects: installation, sculpture, electronics, etc. At the same time, we study different course materials that range from Deleuze's information to Gibson's affordances through materials from Dataphys.org to Ian Gwilt's latest publication. I would like to allow them to contribute to dataphys.org. I also plan to co-write a paper with some of the students on their methodologies and findings that have the potential to contribute to knowledge in the field of data physicalization. |

I'm interested in community-based, co-created, climate-focused data physicalization that functions as both an epistemological and a communications tool.
